        Why did the programmer quit his job? He didn't get arrays. Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because he couldn't C#. Why do programmers always mix up Halloween and Christmas? Because Oct 31 equals Dec 25. Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs. Why do programmers always mix up their Halloween and Christmas decorations? Because they always end up with ghosts in their code. What's a programmer's favorite place to hang out? The Foo Bar. Why do programmers always mix up their left and right? Because they're always working with the "wrong" side of the code.
